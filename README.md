**Project Title: Diabetes Prediction**

**Overview**

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting the onset of diabetes based on patient health data. The primary objective is to provide a tool that can aid healthcare professionals in early diagnosis, potentially improving treatment outcomes and preventing complications.

**Dataset**

* The project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database available on ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)).
* Description of dataset attributes:
    * Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant.
    * Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration.
    * BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
    * SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
    * Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
    * BMI: Body mass index.
    * DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function.
    * Age: Age (years).
    * Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic).

**Methodology**
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   * Handling missing values (imputation or removal).
   * Feature scaling or normalization.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   * Visualizations to understand data distributions and correlations.
3. **Feature Engineering**
   * Potentially creating new features or interactions to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection and Training**
   * Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms:
      * Logistic Regression
      * Decision Trees
      * Random Forests
5. **Evaluation**
   * Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.
   * Cross-validation for robust evaluation.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   * Techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance.

**Project Structure**

* `diabetes.csv` - The raw dataset.
*  The available `.ipynb` file contains the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and model evaluation.
